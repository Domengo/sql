  <h2>JOIN and UEFA EURO 2012</h2>
  <p>This tutorial introduces <code>JOIN</code> which allows you to use data from two or more tables. The tables contain all matches and goals from UEFA EURO 2012 Football Championship in Poland and Ukraine.</p>

<p>The data is available (mysql format) at http://sqlzoo.net/euro2012.sql</p>

<div class="progress_panel"><div>
   <div class="summary">Summary</div>
   <div class="progressbarbg">
     <div class="progressbar"></div>
   </div>
</div></div>

  <div class='extra_space' style='width:1em; height:6em;'></div>
  
<div class='qu'>
The first example shows the goal scored by a player with the last name 'Bender'. The <code>*</code> says to list all the columns in the table - a shorter way of saying <code>matchid, teamid, player, gtime</code>

<p class='imper'>Modify it to show the ''matchid'' and ''player'' name for all goals scored by Germany. To identify German players, check for:
<code>teamid = 'GER'</code></p>

<source lang='sql' class='def'>
SELECT * FROM goal 
  WHERE player LIKE '%Bender'
</source>

<source lang='sql' class='ans'>
SELECT matchid, player 
 FROM goal
   WHERE teamid LIKE 'GER'
</source>
</div>

<div class='qu'>
<p>From the previous query you can see that Lars Bender's scored a goal in game 1012. Now we want to know what teams were playing in that match.</P>
<p>Notice in the that the column <code>matchid</code> in the <code>goal</code> table corresponds to the <code>id</code> column in the <code>game</code> table. We can look up information about game 1012 by finding that row in the '''game''' table.</p>
<p class='imper'>Show id, stadium, team1, team2 for just game 1012</p>

<source lang='sql' class='def'>
SELECT id,stadium,team1,team2
  FROM game 
</source>

<source lang='sql' class='ans'>
SELECT id,stadium,team1,team2
 FROM game
WHERE id=1012</source>
</div>

<div class='qu'>
You can combine the two steps into a single query with a <code>JOIN</code>. 
 SELECT *
   FROM game JOIN goal ON (id=matchid)
<p>The '''FROM''' clause says to merge data from the goal table with that from the game table. The '''ON''' says how to figure out which rows in '''game''' go with which rows in '''goal''' - the '''matchid''' from '''goal''' must match '''id''' from '''game'''. (If we wanted to be more clear/specific we could say <br/><code>ON (game.id=goal.matchid)</code></p>
<p>The code below shows the player (from the goal) and stadium name (from the game table) for every goal scored.</p>
<p class='imper'>Modify it to show the player, teamid, stadium and mdate for every German goal.</p>

<source lang='sql' class='def'>
SELECT player,stadium
  FROM game JOIN goal ON (id=matchid)
</source>

<source lang='sql' class='ans'>
SELECT player,teamid,stadium,mdate
  FROM game JOIN goal ON (id=matchid)
 WHERE teamid='GER'
</source>
</div>

<div class='qu'>
Use the same <code>JOIN</code> as in the previous question.
<p class='imper'>Show the team1, team2 and player for every goal scored by a player called Mario <code>player LIKE 'Mario%'</code></p>

<source lang='sql' class='def'>

</source>

<source lang='sql' class='ans'>
SELECT team1, team2, player
  FROM game JOIN goal ON (id=matchid)
WHERE player LIKE 'Mario%'</source>
</div>

<div class='qu'>
The table <code>eteam</code> gives details of every national team including the coach. You can <code>JOIN</code> <code>goal</code> to <code>eteam</code> using the phrase <code>goal JOIN eteam on teamid=id</code>
<p class='imper'>Show <code>player</code>, <code>teamid</code>, <code>coach</code>, <code>gtime</code> for all goals scored in the first 10 minutes <code>gtime&lt;=10</code></p>

<source lang='sql' class='def'>
SELECT player, teamid, gtime
  FROM goal 
 WHERE gtime<=10
</source>

<source lang='sql' class='ans'>
SELECT player, teamid, coach, gtime
  FROM goal JOIN eteam ON (teamid=id)
 WHERE gtime<=10
</source>
</div>

<div class='qu'>
To <code>JOIN</code> <code>game</code> with <code>eteam</code> you could use either<br/> <code>game JOIN eteam ON (team1=eteam.id)</code> or <code>game JOIN eteam ON (team2=eteam.id)</code>

Notice that because <code>id</code> is a column name in both <code>game</code> and <code>eteam</code> you must specify <code>eteam.id</code> instead of just <code>id</code>
<p class='imper'>List the dates of the matches and the name of the team in which 'Fernando Santos' was the team1 coach.</p>

<source lang='sql' class='def'>

</source>

<source lang='sql' class='ans'>
SELECT mdate,teamname
  FROM game JOIN eteam ON (team1=eteam.id)
WHERE coach='Fernando Santos'
</source>
</div>

<div class='qu'>
<p class='imper'>List the player for every goal scored in a game where the stadium was 'National Stadium, Warsaw'</p>

<source lang='sql' class='def'>
</source>

<source lang='sql' class='ans'>
SELECT player
  FROM goal JOIN game ON (id=matchid)
 WHERE stadium = 'National Stadium, Warsaw'
</source>
</div>



<br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>More difficult questions</h2>
<div class='qu'>
<div>The example query shows all goals scored in the Germany-Greece quarterfinal.</div>

<p class='imper'>Instead show the '''name''' of all players who scored a goal against Germany.</p>
<div class="hint" title="HINT">
Select goals scored only by non-German players in matches where GER was the id of either '''team1''' or '''team2'''.

You can use <code>teamid!='GER'</code> to prevent listing German players.

You can use <code>DISTINCT</code> to stop players being listed twice.
</div>

<source lang='sql' class='def'>
SELECT player, gtime
  FROM game JOIN goal ON matchid = id 
    WHERE (team1='GER' AND team2='GRE') 
</source>

<source lang='sql' class='ans'>
SELECT DISTINCT player
  FROM game JOIN goal ON matchid = id 
 WHERE (team1 = 'GER' OR team2 = 'GER')
   AND teamid!='GER'
</source>
</div>

<div class='qu'>

<div class='imper'>Show '''teamname''' and the total number of goals scored.</div>
<div class="hint" title="COUNT and GROUP BY">
You should COUNT(*) in the SELECT line and GROUP BY teamname
</div>
<source lang='sql' class='def'>
SELECT teamname, player
  FROM eteam JOIN goal ON id=teamid
 ORDER BY teamname
</source>

<source lang='sql' class='ans'>
SELECT teamname,COUNT(teamid)
  FROM eteam JOIN goal ON id=teamid
GROUP BY teamname
</source>
</div>


<div class='qu'>
<div class='imper'>Show the stadium and the number of goals scored in each stadium.
</div>
<source lang='sql' class='def'>
</source>

<source lang='sql' class='ans'>
SELECT stadium,COUNT(1)
  FROM goal JOIN game ON id=matchid
GROUP BY stadium</source>
</div>

<div class='qu'>
<div class='imper'>For every match involving 'POL', show the matchid, date and the number of goals scored.</div>
<source lang='sql' class='def'>
SELECT matchid,mdate, team1, team2,teamid
  FROM game JOIN goal ON matchid = id 
 WHERE (team1 = 'POL' OR team2 = 'POL')
</source>

<source lang='sql' class='ans'>
SELECT matchid,mdate,COUNT(teamid)
  FROM game JOIN goal ON matchid = id 
 WHERE (team1 = 'POL' OR team2 = 'POL')
GROUP BY matchid,mdate
</source>
</div>

<div class='qu'>

<div class='imper'>For every match where 'GER' scored, show matchid, match date and the number of goals scored by 'GER'</div>
<source lang='sql' class='def'>
</source>
<source lang='sql' class='ans'>
SELECT matchid,mdate,COUNT(teamid)
  FROM game JOIN goal ON matchid = id 
 WHERE (teamid='GER')
GROUP BY matchid,mdate
</source>
</div>
<div>

<div class='qu'>

<div class='imper'>List every match with the goals scored by each team as shown. This will use "[[CASE|CASE WHEN]]" which has not been explained in any previous exercises.</div>
<table class="sqlmine">
<tr><th>mdate</th><th>team1</th><th>score1</th><th>team2</th><th>score2</th></tr>
<tr><td>1 July 2012</td><td>ESP</td><td class="r">4</td><td>ITA </td><td class="r">0</td></tr>

<tr><td colspan=5>...</td></tr>
</table>
Notice in the query given every goal is listed. If it was a team1 goal then a 1 appears in score1, otherwise there is a 0. You could SUM this column to get a count of the goals scored by team1. '''Sort your result by mdate, matchid, team1 and team2.'''
<source lang='sql' class='def'>
SELECT mdate,
  team1,
  CASE WHEN teamid=team1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END score1
  FROM game JOIN goal ON matchid = id 
</source>

<source lang='sql' class='ans'>
SELECT mdate,
  team1,
  SUM(CASE WHEN teamid=team1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) score1,
  team2,
  SUM(CASE WHEN teamid=team2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) score2
  FROM game LEFT JOIN goal ON matchid = id 
GROUP BY mdate,matchid,team1,team2
